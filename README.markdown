# 3D Graphics Engine

A 3D graphics engine written in JavaScript by [Brant Wellman](https://github.com/brantwellman) and [Aaron Greenspan](https://github.com/afg419).

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html` to run your application.

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

### Rendering Objects
Sample points and edges are created and rendered in `index.js` to demonstrate how they are generated and placed in the 3D space.

### Player Controls
Controls are also provided in order to navigate through placed objects.  

Basic Controls:
  - W - Move forward
  - S - Move backward
  - A - Rotate left
  - D - Rotate right
  - O - Rotate down
  - L - Rotate up
  - K - Roll left
  - ; - Roll right
